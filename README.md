React Webpack Starter Kit

The idea is to provide a minimal starter kit that could be used for React Projects. The starter makes use of 
* Babel
* Webpack
* react-hot-loader

Babel is a transpiler used to convert ES6 code to ES5 compatible code. Though technically not required for React Applications,
but ES6 features like classes, modules etc. enables us to write more modular and concise code.

Webpack is used for bundling and packaging the application

react-hot-loader is used to Hot LiveReload the Application, anytime the React components are changed

# Run the app
* Install the dependencies using `npm install`
* Do `npm start` to run the `webpack-dev-server` at default port 8080
